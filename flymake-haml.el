;; Usage:
;;   (require 'flymake-haml)
;;   (add-hook 'haml-mode-hook 'flymake-haml-load)
;;
;; `sass-mode' is a derived mode of 'haml-mode', so
;; `flymake-haml-load' is a no-op unless the current major mode is
;; `haml-mode'.

;; TODO: basic haml -c lint checking
;; TODO: abstract the flymake command runner to handle both commands (or update flymake-easy?)
